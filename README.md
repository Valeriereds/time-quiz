# time-quiz

## Description

I started this project with the hope that I could pass on the amateur know-how I've learned so far using Javascript. Over the course of the past week, I tried to built this timed quiz from scratch. Some of the things I've learned how to do through this endeavor are how to implement a timer with a set decrement, properly match an event listener with the necessary conditional statements, and I've also learned that trying to be creative with variable names really did help perk my interest up with writing my code. I hope that they resonate with any other devs who come upon this amateur project. Towards the end of this project, I did have trouble with my score sheet and linking the local storage as well as the separate high score page. But I hope with more time and repetitive learning and googling, I can find the answer and add features to this project in the future.
